# 🎓 SchoolStuff  (a.k.a. Homework Dump)

This repo is **not** organized. It’s not clean. It’s not even consistent. And missing many more shit.  

It’s just… everything I could find on my PC related to school, assignments, and random course work.  
If you came here looking for structure, I `o7` your optimism.

- Random code files that may or may not compile  
- Projects or homework I totally meant to finish
