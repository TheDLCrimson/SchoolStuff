## Neural Network Implementation

In this section , your task is to implement a Neural Network from scratch to classify images of handwritten letters.

The code for this assignment consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore.

Files you can edit:

 - `neural network.py`: Your code to implement, train, and execute your neural network.
 - `additional code.py`: Add additional code that you will need to write to answer various questions will go here. This code should be runnable by calling `python additional code.py`, but there are no requirements on the format and it will not be executed by the autograder.

Files you might want to look at:

 - `test cases/Q*/*.py` These are the unit tests that the autograder runs. Ideally, you would be writing these unit tests yourself, but we are saving you a bit of time and allowing the autograder to check these things. You should definitely be looking at these to see what is and is not being tested.
 - `test utils.py` Utility file used by the test case code.
 - `Reference Outputs` Data files used by the test case code.

Files you can safely ignore
 - `autograder.py` Autograder infrastructure code.

This assignment includes an autograder for you to grade your some aspects of your code on your machine. This can be run with the command:

 - `python autograder.py`


## And that's all folks!

Thanks for having made it here. Goodluck and Have fun.
